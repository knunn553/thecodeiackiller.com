<h2> This is a change that I am making on MacBook to see if I can merge correctly back into a Windows operating system with
no merge conflicts. If I'm able to merge on github, then pull down, edit, push, then pull again to my mac, then we should be good. </h2>
<h2> Now we have unset autocrlf setting on Mac to see if we run into merge conflicts after fetching data from forked repo onto local MacBook forked repo</h2>
